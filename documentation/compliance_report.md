## Compliance Report

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- The application uses AWS Cognito for secure user identity management.
- All API requests require a valid JWT token passed in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` schema.
- Unauthorized requests return a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### 2. Data Protection

- No personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data is stored on the server.
- API keys and secrets are stored securely using environment variables (`.env`) and never committed to source control.

### 3. API Security

- API routes are protected by verifying the presence and validity of the JWT.
- Rate limiting is implemented via `flask-limiter` to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow only specific frontend origins if needed.

### 4. Logging & Auditing

- All inbound requests to critical routes (`/generate`) are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - User ID (from token)
  - Prompt metadata
  - Response status
- Logging is centralized through Flaskâ€™s logging module and can be redirected to AWS CloudWatch or another secure log aggregator.
- Logs are stored securely and can be used for audit trails and debugging

### 5. Dependency & Vulnerability Management

- Python dependencies are pinned and managed using `pip` and `requirements.txt`.
- JavaScript dependencies are audited with `npm audit` and `npm audit fix`.
- Regular checks using `pytest-cov` ensure test coverage is maintained above 80%.
- Known CVEs are actively patched during development cycles.

### 6. AI Model Safety & Content Filtering

- The application leverages OpenAI and Bedrock models with built-in safety filters
- Prompts and completions are passed through additional checks when appropriate (e.g., profanity filters).
- User inputs that violate policy (e.g., unsafe or toxic language) are blocked and logged with warnings.

### 7. Deployment & Environment

- Environment-specific secrets are stored in `.env` files and loaded via `python-dotenv`.
- The production environment is isolated and does not expose debugging or internal stack traces to users.
- A virtual environment (`venv`) is used to isolate project dependencies.

### 8. Compliance Considerations

- While not certified, the application aligns with key principles of:
  - SOC 2 (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
  - GDPR (Data Minimization, Consent, Right to Access/Deletion)
- No PII is collected, stored, or processed outside Cognito or secure model providers.
